Meteor Package accounts-ldap
============================

typ wrote the original accounts-ldap in a ham-fistedly non-agnostic manner, with the finesse of a pregnant rhino on crack; i scrapped literally 95% of the LDAP functionality and rewrote it so it doesn't suck now and also is significantly more generic. the meteor integration was fine and i left it pretty much unchanged. package isn't done yet but by god it's not a steaming pile either.
